Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

amazon_bags_webscrap.ipynb: The main Python script containing the web scraping logic.
requirements.txt: A file containing the required Python libraries. Install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
README.md: The documentation file you are currently reading.

Usage
Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.
Open the amazon_bags_webscrap.ipynb file and modify the URL variable to the Amazon webpage you want to scrape.
